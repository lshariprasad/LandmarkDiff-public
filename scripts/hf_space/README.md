# LandmarkDiff

Anatomically-conditioned facial surgery outcome prediction from standard clinical photography.

Upload a face photo, select a surgical procedure, adjust intensity, and see the predicted outcome in real time using thin-plate spline warping on CPU.

## Features

- **Single Procedure**: Predict the outcome of one procedure at a chosen intensity
- **Compare All**: See all six procedures side by side at the same intensity
- **Intensity Sweep**: View a single procedure from 0% to 100% in six steps
- **Symmetry Analysis**: Measure bilateral facial symmetry across five regions, with pre/post comparison

## Supported Procedures

| Procedure | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rhinoplasty** | Nose reshaping (bridge, tip, alar width) |
| **Blepharoplasty** | Eyelid surgery (lid position, canthal tilt) |
| **Rhytidectomy** | Facelift (midface and jawline tightening) |
| **Orthognathic** | Jaw surgery (maxilla/mandible repositioning) |
| **Brow Lift** | Brow elevation and forehead ptosis reduction |
| **Mentoplasty** | Chin surgery (projection and vertical height) |

## How It Works

1. **MediaPipe landmarks** -- 478-point facial mesh extraction
2. **Anatomical displacement** -- procedure-specific landmark shifts scaled by intensity (0-100)
3. **TPS deformation** -- thin-plate spline warps the image smoothly
4. **Masked compositing** -- blends the surgical region back into the original photo

GPU modes (ControlNet, img2img) with photorealistic rendering are available in the full package.

## Photo Tips

- Use a front-facing, well-lit photo with a neutral expression
- Remove glasses, hats, or anything covering the face
- Make sure only one face is clearly visible
- At least 256x256 resolution recommended
